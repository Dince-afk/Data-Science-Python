- In this notebook I have analyzed TED talks that are related to climate change and environmental issues. 
- Questions: How did climate change related topics change over time? How do views and likes for different topics differ? 
- Tools: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `re`, `Matplotlib`

## Programs

### [YouTube API to Database Automated Pipeline](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data_Science/blob/main/1.%20Projects%20and%20Showcases/youtube_api_db.ipynb)
- Downloading and processing data from the YouTube API and downloading it to a database.
- Tools: `requests`, `pandas`, `time`, `mysql`
