# Data Science in Python

Here is a compilation of data analysis and science work I have written in Python over the years.

## Projects

**[TED talks and climate change](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data-Analysis-Science-Python/blob/da9e3f2cd6b1a5e425515e735d2a04a7f6f28005/Projects/ted_talks_climate.ipynb)**

- In this notebook I have analyzed TED talks that are related to climate change and environmental issues. 
- Questions: How did climate change related topics change over time? How do views and likes for different topics differ? 
- Tools: NumPy, Pandas, re, Matplotlib

## Programs

**[Automation pipeline](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data_Science/blob/main/1.%20Projects%20and%20Showcases/youtube_api_db.ipynb)**
- Downloading and processing data from the YouTube API and downloading it to a database.
