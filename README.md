# Data Science in Python

Here is a compilation of data science work I have written in Python and worked over the years on.

## Projects

### [TED Talks and Climate Change](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data_Science/blob/main/1.%20Projects%20and%20Showcases/ted_talks_climate.ipynb)

- In this notebook I have analyzed TED talks that are related to climate change and environmental issues. 
- Questions: How did climate change related topics change over time? How do views and likes for different topics differ? 
- Tools: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `re`, `Matplotlib`

### [Twitter API Data Analysis]()

## Programs

### [YouTube API to Database Automated Pipeline](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data_Science/blob/main/1.%20Projects%20and%20Showcases/youtube_api_db.ipynb)
- Downloading and processing data from the YouTube API and downloading it to a database.
- Tools: `requests`, `pandas`, `time`, `mysql`
