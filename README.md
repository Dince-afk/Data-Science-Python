# Data Analysis and Science in Python

This is a compilation of data analysis and science work I have written in Python over the years.

## Projects

- [TED talks and climate change](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data-Analysis-Science-Python/blob/da9e3f2cd6b1a5e425515e735d2a04a7f6f28005/Projects/ted_talks_climate.ipynb): 
  - In this notebook I have analyzed TED talks that are related to climate change and environmental issues. 
  - Questions: How did climate change related topics change over time? How do views and likes for different topics differ? 
  - Tools: NumPy, Pandas, re, Matplotlib




- [European Social Survey Analysis for Germany](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data-Analysis-Science-Python/blob/master/Projects/ess_de.ipynb): 
  - Questions: How does happiness relate to health? How did political left and right values change over time in Germany?
  - Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data-Analysis-Science-Python/blob/master/Regression/1.%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression/simple_linear_regression.ipynb):
  - My notebook template for regression analyses. 
  - Tools: NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib

- [European Social Survey Analysis](https://github.com/Dince-afk/Data-Analysis-Science-Python/blob/master/Projects/ess.ipynb): 
  - Tools: NumPy, Pandas, re, Matplotlib
